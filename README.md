# Welcome to the Carleton AI Society Fall 2019 project!

We're going to be making an artificial intelligence that wins at Rock, Paper, Scissors!
It's been done before, but it's a good project to get your feet wet in AI.

### Task 1: add your name to the project members file.

### Task 2: run the demo-file on your computer.

I suggest you use a pretty code viewing text editor like this: https://www.sublimetext.com/.

Find the demo files with a description here: https://github.com/sachag678/freeCodeCamp.

Save the html an js files on your computer in the same folder and open the html file.

#### At the first project meeting we will create a project outline.
