# Welcome to the Carleton AI Society Fall 2019 project!

We're going to be making an artificial intelligence that wins at Rock, Paper, Scissors!
It's been done before, but it's a good project to get your feet wet in AI.

### Task 1: Open the shared google doc.
[Project Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oG6n_vd1Fgdpourc7Dl1LbjLy_fLD1V5E2WEWUQd4TA/edit?usp=sharing)

We will create a project outline before we leave today.

### Task 2: add your name to the project members readme file.

### Task 3: run the demo-file on your computer.

I suggest you use a pretty code viewing text editor like this: https://www.sublimetext.com/.

Find the demo files with a description here: https://github.com/sachag678/freeCodeCamp.

Save the html and js files on your computer in the same folder and open the html file.

### Task 4: download the language you'll be using
(we're going to decide today which of these we need)

https://www.python.org/

https://www.scipy.org/

https://pytorch.org/

https://www.tensorflow.org/
