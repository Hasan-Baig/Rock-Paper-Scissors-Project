# Welcome to the Carleton AI Society Fall 2019 project!

We're going to be making an artificial intelligence that wins at Rock, Paper, Scissors!
It's been done before, but it's a good project to get your feet wet in AI.

### Task 1: add your name to the project members file.

### Task 2: set-up python on your computer.
The demo doesn't use it but we will.

### Task 3: run the demo-file on your computer.
